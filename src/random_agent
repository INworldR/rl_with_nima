# Here you create an env and let an agent interact with it. You can measure how
# successful is the random agent, i.e. how much reward it accumulates.

# 0 - Create an env
import gymnasium as gym

# env = gym.make("CartPole-v1", render_mode="rgb_array")
env = gym.make("MountainCar-v0", render_mode="rgb_array")

# 1 - Reset the env.
env.reset()

# 2 - Let a random agent interact with the env.
#
# 2.1. Choose a random action (with in the action space of the env.)
import random
num_actions = env.action_space.n
print("Action space:", num_actions)

action_list = [n for n in range(0, num_actions)]
print("Action list", action_list)
action = random.choice(action_list)
print("First random action:", action)
# 2.2. and pass it to the environment
_, r1, terminated, truncated, _ = env.step(action)
# 2.3. How much reward did you get for that action? Keep the score!
print("First reward:", r1)
# 2.4. Repeat the 2.{1,2,3} until the end of the episode
total_reward = r1
while not (terminated or truncated):
    action = random.choice(action_list)
    _, r2, terminated, truncated, _ = env.step(action)
    total_reward += r2

# 2.5. How much total reward you got? What does it mean to have large/small reward?
print("Total reward:", total_reward)
# 3. Repeat the whole section 2. Do you get the same total reward?
